									<p><b>9.1</b> Right of Access</p>
									<p>You have the right to access information held about you and you can ask us for a copy of the information at any time. Where we have good reason, and if the law permits, we can refuse your request for a copy of your personal data, or certain elements of the request.
										 If we refuse your request or any element of it, we will provide you with our reasons for doing so.</p>
									<p><b>9.2</b> Right of Correction or Completion</p>
									<p>If personal data we control and hold about you is not accurate or needs updating you have a right of rectification (we can easily correct some of your personal data like an email address upon your instruction, but we cannot unilaterally amend your credit 
										card transaction data if supplied to us in error by a third party) .</p>
									<p><b>9.3</b> Right of Erasure</p>
									<p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that personal data we hold about you is erased for example if the information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or processed or our processing of the information is based on your consent and there are no other legal
										 grounds on which we may process the information.</p>
									<p><b>9.4</b> Right to Object to or Restrict Processing</p>
									<p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data by contacting us. You have the right to object to use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. You have a legal right to object at any time to: (i) use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes; and (ii) processing of your personal data which is based on our
										 legitimate interests, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for our continued processing.</p>
									<p><b>9.5</b> Right of Data Portability</p>
									<p>To save you time, you should know that the vast majority of the personal data and transaction data you would want to port across to other systems, devices or software solutions are readily downloadable from our platform and the Moneyhub App. (It is highly unlikely if you are a website visitor we will 
										have any personal data you would wish to port).</p>
										<p>Where your request to move or migrate is more complex than you simply downloading the data that you need from the platform, you can ask us to transmit your data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Of course, we cannot guarantee technical compatibility with a third party organisation’s systems if that is your desired destination and we cannot accede to requests that 
											involve personal data belonging to other persons.</p>
									<p><b>9.6</b> Marketing</p>
									<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will only process your personal data for such purposes where you agree to such processing
										 (e.g., by checking certain boxes on the forms or registration pages we use to collect your information).</p>
										 <p>If you have previously agreed to us using your personal data for marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by contacting us at marketing@slatemoney.io. 
											You will also be given the opportunity to unsubscribe when you receive marketing messages.</p>
									<p><b>9.7</b> Most of the above rights are subject to limitations and exceptions. We will provide reasons if we are unable to comply with any request for the exercise of your rights.</p>
									<p>To the extent that we are processing your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us.</p>
									<p>We aim to keep your personal data up-to-date, so please advise us of any changes and feel free to exercise any of the above rights by contacting us at
